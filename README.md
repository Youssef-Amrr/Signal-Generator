# Signal-Generator
Signal Generator program using MATLAB
The specifications for the programs will be as follows:

1. When the program starts the program asks the user for the following parameters:
a. Sampling frequency of signal
b. Start and end of time scale
c. Number of the breakpoints and their positions (i.e.the points that the signal definition rule changes).

2. According to the number of breakpoints the program asks the user at each region to enter the specifications of the signal at this region which are:
a. DC signal : Amplitude.
b. Ramp signal : slope–intercept.
c. General order polynomial : Amplitude-power–intercept.
d. Exponential signal : Amplitude–exponent.
e. Sinusoidal signal : Amplitude–frequency–phase.

3. Display the resulting signal in time

4. The program asks the user if he wants to perform any operation on the signal:
a. Amplitude Scaling : scale value.
b. Time reversal. 
c. Time shift : shift value.
d. Expanding the signal : expanding value.
e. Compressing the signal:compressing value
f.None

5.Display the new signal in time domain.
